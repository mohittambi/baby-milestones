# Baby Shopping, Care & Play Guide (Month 0–36)

> **Purpose:** Month-by-month shopping list, care guides (bath, massage, pacifier), holding games, and clothes — with verified FirstCry and Amazon India links.  
> **Sources:** IAP Pediatric Skin Care Guidelines (2021), WHO, AAP/AAPD, FirstCry, Amazon India, Indian parenting research (BMC Pediatrics), Me n Moms, Urbanrac, Babynama.  
> **App integration:** Data in `src/data/shoppingAndCare.js`. **Shopping** tab uses `ShoppingChecklist` with month range; **Care** on each month page via `CareSection`. FirstCry search links use `/search?q=` (not `/s?q=` — returns 404).  
> **Disclaimer:** Lists are personal recommendations from products and routines we have used—not exhaustive, not medical advice.

## Important Corrections

| What was originally mentioned | What research found |
|---|---|
| **Just Born breast pump** | [Just Born](https://www.justborn.in/) sells clothes, bedding, prams, cots, toys — **does NOT sell breast pumps**. Use **Babyhug**, **Philips Avent**, **Medela**, or **R for Rabbit** instead. |
| **Baby Hug carrier** | The brand on FirstCry is **Babyhug** (FirstCry's own brand), not "Baby Hug". |
| **Fisher Price sterilizer** | Available as **SteamMax** (~₹2,869) and **DryMax** (sterilize + dry, ~₹5,950). |

## Baby Bath — Complete Guide

### Timing and Frequency

| Topic | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **First bath (after birth)** | Delay **24 hours** after birth. Minimum **6 hours** if culturally required. Baby must be thermally and cardiorespiratory stable. |
| **Until umbilical cord falls off (1–3 weeks)** | **Sponge bath ONLY** — no tub immersion. Keep cord stump clean and dry. |
| **After cord heals** | Tub bath allowed |
| **Frequency — newborn** | **2–3× per week** (IAP/WHO). Daily face/neck/diaper area wipe is fine. |
| **Duration** | **5–10 minutes maximum** (IAP) |
| **Water temperature** | **37–37.5°C** — test with elbow or inner wrist |
| **Room** | Warm, draft-free (~26°C) |
| **After feeding** | Wait **30 minutes** before bathing |

### Sponge Bath Steps (Month 1)

1. Warm room (~26°C); gather towel, Sebamed wash, diaper, clothes, bowl of lukewarm water
2. Lay baby on firm surface; keep partially wrapped
3. Face first with plain water (no soap in eyes)
4. Hair 2–3× per week with Sebamed Shampoo
5. Body section by section; diaper area last
6. Pat dry; apply lotion on slightly damp skin

### Tub Bath Steps (after cord falls)

1. Fill tub with 2–3 inches lukewarm water (37–38°C)
2. Support head and neck with one hand always
3. Face → hair → body → diaper area last
4. Total time 5–10 minutes; pat dry and moisturize

### Dos

- Use pH 5.5 baby wash (Sebamed Gentle Wash)
- Support head and neck at all times
- Test water temperature with elbow
- Pat dry gently; apply lotion on damp skin

### Don'ts

- Never leave baby unattended in or near water
- No tub until umbilical cord falls off
- No adult soap, bubble bath under 6 months
- No hot water; don't bathe immediately after feeding
- No oil or talc on umbilical cord stump

## Baby Massage — Complete Guide

### When to Start

Wait until umbilical cord falls off (**week 2–3**). Some experts recommend 10–15 days before applying oil.

### Frequency by Age

| Age | Frequency | Duration | Best time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 2–4 | Once daily | 5–10 min | Before bath (morning) |
| Month 1–3 | 1–2× daily | 10–15 min | Before bath or bedtime |
| Month 4–6 | Once daily or every other day | 10–15 min | Before bath |
| Month 7–12 | 2–3× per week | 10–15 min | Bedtime routine |
| Month 12+ | 2–3× per week | 10–15 min | Bedtime |

**Indian context:** ~94% of Indian families massage daily; 77% massage before bathing (BMC Pediatrics study).

### Oils (India)

Coconut oil (most recommended), sesame (til), mustard (North India — filtered only), or fragrance-free baby oil. Warm oil in palms before applying.

### Technique (gentle strokes only)

1. Legs: long strokes thigh to ankle
2. Arms: milking stroke shoulder to wrist
3. Tummy: clockwise circles (aids gas)
4. Chest: outward from center
5. Back: neck to bottom on tummy
6. Face: gentle forehead and cheeks (avoid eyes)

### Dos

- Start after cord heals; warm oil in palms
- Massage when calm and alert; wait 30–45 min after feeding
- Stop if baby fusses

### Don'ts

- No massage before cord falls off
- No firm pressure or joint stretching
- No massage immediately after feeding

## Pacifier — Dos and Don'ts

### When to Introduce

| Feeding type | When |
|---|---|

| **Bottle feeding** | From birth or when baby shows comfort-sucking cues |

### Recommended Features

One-piece silicone, BPA-free, orthodontic nipple, shield ≥ 1.5 inches with ventilation holes.

### Dos

1. Wait until breastfeeding established (Month 2–3)
2. Sterilize before first use; clean daily
3. Offer between or after feedings — not when hungry
4. Offer at sleep time (AAP: SIDS risk reduction)
5. Replace every 2–3 months or if cracked
6. Wean gradually starting Month 6–12

### Don'ts

1. Don't introduce in Week 1 if breastfeeding
2. Don't replace or delay feeds with pacifier
3. Don't force if baby refuses
4. Don't tie around neck (strangulation risk)
5. Don't dip in honey or sugar
6. Don't use broken or cracked pacifiers
7. Don't reinsert once baby is asleep (AAP)
8. Aim to stop by 12–18 months

### Weaning Timeline

| Age | Action |
|---|---|
| Month 6 | AAP: consider weaning to reduce ear infections |
| Month 12 | Health risks increase; aim to wean |
| Month 18–24 | Should be fully weaned |
