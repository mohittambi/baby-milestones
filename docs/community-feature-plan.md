# Coral Community Feature — Phased Implementation Plan

> **Tagline:** "from a mom to new age moms"  
> **Target:** Gen Z & late Millennial parents, especially new moms  
> **Source inspiration:** @avira.ig (Instagram recipes)

## Phase 1: Foundation & Bug Fixes ✅
**Goal:** Fix existing issues and set up core infrastructure

### 1.1 Modal Bug Fix
- [x] Fix mobile modal positioning (portal to `document.body` — was trapped in card grid)
- [x] Ensure modal is vertically centered in viewport (flex center on fixed backdrop)
- [x] Add `max-height: min(80dvh, calc(100dvh - 48px))` for mobile
- [x] iOS scroll lock (`body { position: fixed; top: -scrollY }`) so page doesn't shift
- [x] Verify modal scrolls correctly when content overflows (backdrop `overflow-y: auto`)

### 1.2 Core Hooks Setup
- [x] Create `src/hooks/useMemories.js` with localStorage persistence
- [x] Create `src/hooks/useComments.js` for in-memory comments
- [x] Create `src/hooks/useSwipe.js` for swipe gesture detection
- [x] Write unit tests for hooks (optional but recommended)

### 1.3 Data Structure Setup
- [x] Create `src/data/recipes.js` with 3-5 sample recipes from avira.ig
- [x] Create `src/data/parentingTips.js` with "Baby Teething" as first tip
